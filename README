Assignment: Program 2
Instructor: Professor Phillip Nico
Course: CPE 453-03

Program Instructions:
    
    1. In order to build the shared library "liblwp.so" all you would have
       to run is:
       
           $ make liblwp.so

               or

           $ make all

               or

           $ make

    2. Then you would need to link the shared library with the program
       you are compiling. In order to do so, you need to set your
       LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:

           $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/wherever/your/library/is:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
           $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH

       Then when you compile, make sure to include a -L/path/to/file flag
       followed by liblwp.so.
       For example:
       
            gcc -Wall -g -I -o progname prog.o -L/path/to/file liblwp.so

    3. Finally you can run your program using our lwp library functions. 
       Make sure lwp.h is included in your program. Then you will have access
       to all the lwp library functions.

Important Notes:

    1. We passed all of the given test cases. It was difficult to check for
       memory leaks using valgrind, so we are not 100% sure if there are leaks.
       But we did free as much as we malloced for some test cases we ran (nums 
       for example), so we think there might an issue with using valgrind
       with our program.
